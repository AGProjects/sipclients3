How to import TLS cert on Mac

You must create a .p12 file.  In order to do that you need your private key
and a certificate for that key.  Then run the following on your console:

openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -inkey default.crt -in default.crt -out blink.p12 -name "Blink Client"

Then import blink.p12 into Keychain
