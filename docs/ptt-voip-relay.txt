PTT Radio - VoIP relay
----------------------

Using va-recorder and sip-audio-session or sip-session scripts one can relay
audio between a PTT radio and Voice over IP using SIP Protocol.

A typical usage scenario would be two PTT radios in different geographical
locations being bridged using VoIP over IP.

The general purpose IO board provided by Raspberry Pi computer can control
the PTT button of the Radio or detect when the radio has been paged from
remote.  This software in this package completes the puzzle.
