PTT Radio - VoIP relay
----------------------

Using va-recorder and sip-audio-session or sip-session scripts one can relay
audio between a PTT radio and Voice over IP using SIP Protocol.

A typical usage scenario would be two PTT radios in different geographical
locations being bridged using VoIP over IP.  For example, by using the
general purpose IO board provided by Raspberry Pi computer, one can control
the PTT button of an external Radio device or detect when the radio has been
paged from remote.  This software in this package completes the puzzle.

To execute external scripts wheil handling audio calls, create inside the
folder ~/.sipclient/scripts/ scripts with the following name patterns:

 - alice@example.com-incoming-start
 - alice@example.com-incoming-end
 - alice@example.com-outgoing-end
 - alice@example.com-outgoing-start
 - alice@example.com-outgoing-fail
